Questions:  Why am I using Local strategy? Do jwt strategies require local strategies? That seems wrong.
    - How do I set the header? The proper way to use JWT is to set it as the "Authorization" header with "bearer the_token"
        - I can't conditionally set a app.use() can I?
        - Would I add a function to app.use() that sees if the user is authenticated? Wouldn't that mean I'd have to set a global variable?


Goal: get the POST login request to actually set the Authorization header so the user is logged in for "some duration" of time.



This version works ONLY with POSTMAN.

POST request
    - url: localhost:3000/signup
    - Body (select Body in the tabs)
    - x-www-form-urlencoded
    - key values:  key: email, value: some@emailaddress.com, key: password, value: password,
    hit send.

POsT request:
    - url: localhost:3000/login
    - Body
    - x-www-form-urlencoded
    - email: (same as /signup)
    - password: (same as /signup)

    /login outputs a token.

    use the token on secured routes.

GET localhost:3000/user/profile
Params
pass in token:

secret_token my_token
